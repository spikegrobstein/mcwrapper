# Example configuration for mcwrapper: mcwrapper.conf
# this file can live in any of the following places (in order of priority):
#  - the value of MCWRAPPER_CONFIG_PATH env variable
#  - the current working directory as "mcwrapper.conf"
#  - ~/.mcwrapper.conf
#  - /etc/mcwrapper.conf
#
# Configuration is actual Bash. You can use conditionals... not that you would.

## All non-absolute paths are relative to mcwrapper.

# MINECRAFT_SERVER_PATH -- path to the minecraft_server.jar
# default: either minecraft_server.jar in same directory or one level up.
# MINECRAFT_SERVER_PATH="/usr/local/minecraft/minecraft_server.jar"

# JAVA_BIN -- the java binary.
# default: 'java' binary in your path.
# change this if you'd like to use a different java binary.
JAVA_BIN='java'

# Java VM settings (increasing these never hurts)
# these are suggested settings from minecraft.net

# set backup name to
#   +%Y%m%d       -- just the datestamp; no time.
#   +%Y%m%d%H%M%S -- full timestamp including hour, minute, second
#CURRENT_BACKUP_NAME=`date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`

# How to compress the backup
